This program was designed to help with an issue I encountered in my home. My 
roommate and I use a communal NAS device in our home to store movies television
shows. My roommate updates the NAS with new media fairly often. He does not keep
track of what he is adding to let me know when there are shows or movies that I
may be interested in. To help with this I am creating this small program to
cataloge the contents of the NAS to a database file starting from the base
directory. I will then be putting together a program to read the database file
and inform me of what new files have been added since my last inquiry. Since all
data about when the files are added will be stored in the database file I will
be able look back and find what files have been added since certain dates, what
files are newest or any other useful queries I come up with.
